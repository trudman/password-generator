# Professional Password Generator

## Description

This project is my javascript random password generator. My Motivation for this project was to become more familiar with javascript and adding functionality to HTML and CSS. This allows me to become mroe comfrtbale with the different functions and variables in javascript. This was a good exercise to use reason and logic to think through the various aspects of the password generator.

Completing this project has really helped me to familiarize myself with javascript concepts and syntax. It was very challenging but I feel that it will give me a solid foundation to build upon as we progress thrugh the class.
